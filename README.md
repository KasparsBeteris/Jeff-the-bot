# Jeff The Bot
This bot was created using Bot Framework v4. It is hosted on Microsoft Azure services. When the code is uploaded into Github, the Azure App Service automatically updates the hosted bot.

For Question and Answer storage the bot uses an AI based cognitive service, which allows the user to communicate with the bot in differently organized phrases as well as different words. With the implemented AI the bot has more human-like behavior.

[Dashbot.io](https://www.dashbot.io/) has been added to gather data and view various analytics for user interaction, like the amount of users who interacted with the bot, the questions they asked and the answers they chose, behavior flows etc. The bot can alert you if pre-set events are triggered. For example, an e-mail is sent to the owner of the bot to TakeOver the control of the chat if the bot can not answer a question and the user wishes to talk with a live person.
